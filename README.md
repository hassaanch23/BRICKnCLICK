# BRICKnCLICK

A modern, full-stack real estate marketplace platform that enables users to buy, sell, and rent properties with real-time chat functionality and advanced property management features.

## 📋 Project Description

BRICKnCLICK is a comprehensive real estate application that connects property buyers, sellers, and renters. The platform provides an intuitive interface for listing properties, searching for homes, managing favorites, and communicating with potential buyers or sellers through real-time chat. Users can create detailed property listings with images, track analytics, receive notifications, and manage their property portfolio all in one place.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Many existing property marketplaces separate listing management, messaging, and analytics into different tools or services. That fragmentation makes it hard for small agencies and individual sellers to manage listings, respond quickly to inquiries, and understand listing performance in one place. BRICKnCLICK solves this by integrating listing management, real-time communication, image handling, and analytics into a single, easy-to-use platform.
